# JUnit support

cargo-nextest can produce output in the [JUnit/XUnit XML format](https://llg.cubic.org/docs/junit/). This format is widely understood by test analysis tools and libraries.

To enable JUnit support, add this to your [nextest configuration](configuration.md):

```toml
[profile.ci.junit]  # this can be some other profile, too
path = "junit.xml"
```

If `--profile ci` is selected on the command line, a JUnit report will be written out to `target/nextest/ci/junit.xml` within the workspace root.

Some notes about the JUnit support:
* There are several slightly different formats all called "JUnit" or "XUnit". cargo-nextest adheres to the [Jenkins XML format](https://llg.cubic.org/docs/junit/).
* Every test binary forms a single `<testsuite>`. Every test forms a single `<testcase>`.
* Standard output and standard error are included for failed and retried tests. (However, [invalid XML characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valid_characters_in_XML) are stripped out.)

## Post-processing

Some tools that read JUnit files don't follow the Jenkins standard. You can post-process the JUnit file in such cases. Here's some recommendations for post-processing tools written by community members:
* CircleCI: [`circleci-junit-fix`](https://github.com/conradludgate/circleci-junit-fix)

## Example

Here's an example JUnit file generated by `cargo-nextest`.

```xml
{{#include ../../../fixtures/nextest-tests-junit.xml}}
```
